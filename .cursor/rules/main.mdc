This is the repository hosting the code for the website minimal-agent.com. It describes how to build a minimal AI agent for terminal use and more.

Right now this should be fundamentally a one-page website that is very minimalistic.

It should be written in Markdown files.

You need to set it up so that it renders to a static html website.

Use python to render the website.

The markdown should support adding html content in it and we might add our own directives for admonitions, foldouts, tabbed content, etc.
